## SEO for web:
Search engine optimization, or SEO, is the process of improving your website so that it achieves a higher ranking on the top of search-engine results. Here are some HTML tags you should improve in relation to SEO so you get a higher ranking in the search results. 

### `<title>` Tag <br>
Title tags are important because it tells Search Engines what your webpage is about. If you don’t have a good `<title>` tag, Search Engines won’t rank you highly for certain 
Search Keywords. <br>

##### Information: <br> 
Titles should be between 50­70 characters, because they get cut off by Search Engines. You should put important keywords at the beginning of the `<title>`. Each `<title>` should be unique. Put the Brand name after the `<title>` <br>

### `<meta name="description">` Tag <br>
Meta description tags are important because they ​provide short explanations of the contents of 
your webpages. Meta descriptions are commonly used on search engine result pages (SERPs) to 
display preview snippets for a given page. <br>

##### Best Practices: <br>
Best Under 155 Characters. Any longer and it will get cut off by the Search Engine. Each Description is Unique. Well written meta tags influence people clicking to your website (click through rate) <br>

### `<img src="frog bikes yellow kidsbike 14" alt="yellow kidsbike">` Tag <br>

Image alt tags are important because Search Engines use `<img alt>` tags to understand what that image is about. If you have a descriptive image, Search Engines will rank it for that description. <br>
* bad example `<img src="picture.png alt="DSC4536">` <br>
* good example  `<img src="picture.png alt="notre dame paris sunrise">` <br><br>

Image file names is also important for your rankings. The filename should be descriptive, include applicable keywords and use hyphens instead of spaces to separate words.
* bad example `<img src="picture.png" alt="DSC4536">` <br>
* good example  `<img src="frog bikes yellow kidsbike 14">` <br>


### `<a href="http://www.example.com">Insert Anchor text here</a>` Tag <br>

Anchor Text is the visible, clickable text in a link. Anchor text is often blue and underlined, such as 
this link​. (the words “this link” is the anchor text)  <br>

Anchor text is important because ​Search engines use this text to help determine the subject matter of the linked­to webpage. If the anchor text says “Chicago Dentist” and the URL it links to is ​www.bigsmiledental.com​ , the Search Engine will know that www.bigsmiledental.com​ is about Chicago Dentists. <br>
* bad example `<a href="https://bigsmiledental.com/">Big Smile Dental</a>` <br>
* good example  `<a href="https://bigsmiledental.com/">Chicago Dentist</a>` <br>
